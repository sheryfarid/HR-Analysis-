# HR Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing human resources (HR) data to gain insights using MySQL for data cleaning and analysis, followed by visualizing the results through a dashboard in Power BI.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Performed initial data cleaning in MySQL to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data formatting issues.
    - Structured the HR dataset for efficient querying and analysis.

2. **Data Analysis in MySQL**:
    - Analyzed the cleaned data using SQL queries to derive insights related to employee demographics, performance, retention rates, and other key HR metrics.
    - Used SQL for aggregation, filtering, and complex queries to understand patterns and trends in the HR data.

3. **Dashboard Creation in Power BI**:
    - Imported the analyzed data from MySQL into Power BI.
    - Created a dynamic dashboard to visualize key HR metrics, including:
        - Employee distribution by department, age, and experience.
        - Performance evaluation and trends over time.
        - Retention rates and turnover analysis.
